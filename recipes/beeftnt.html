        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ pounds beef round steak</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Slice beef into 3/4-inch strips; then slice these pieces, at an angle, into smaller "tips." Season beef with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Transfer in beef, arranging in a single layer. Let the meat sear
                     until browned, 3 to 5 minutes, before turning over and browning the other side.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium and add tomato paste, garlic, and butter. Stir everything until the butter melts, and then stir in the 
                    flour. Cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Stir in broth. Raise heat to high and bring to a simmer. Reduce to low, cover, and cook until beef is starting to get tender, 
                    about 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
